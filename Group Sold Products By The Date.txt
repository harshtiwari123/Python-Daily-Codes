
--------------------------- Group Sold Products By The Date----------------------------
-- Algorithm
-- Group and Concatenate: Group products by sell_date and concatenate them into a single string.
-- Count Commas: Calculate the number of commas in the concatenated string to count distinct products.
-- Add 1: Since GROUP_CONCAT includes the last comma, add 1 to get the correct number of distinct products.SELECT 
    




p.sell_date,(LENGTH(p.products) - LENGTH(REPLACE(p.products, ',', ''))) + 1 AS num_sold,
    p.products

         sell_date,
         GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product) AS products
     FROM 
         Activities
